Single cell suspension was prepared according to the protocol of Act-seq.","We assessed astrocyte diversity in the cortex, hippocampus, and striatum using sing cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq). We also assessed cortical astrocytes in wild type control and transgenic APP/PS1dE9 mice using scRNA-seq.",Diversity of astrocytes across the mouse CNS [scRNA-seq]
