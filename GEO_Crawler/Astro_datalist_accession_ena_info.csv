The brain was immediately dissected out and was sectioned into 400 mm slices in ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (ACSF) oxygenated with 95% O2 and 5% CO2 and immediately transferred to an oxygenated recovery solution. The cortical, hippocampal, or striatal tissue was dissected out in ice-cold ACSF and cut into small pieces. The tissue was digested in ACSF containing 1 mg/ml pronase at 34 Â°C for 30 min. The digested tissue was dissociated in ice-cold oxygenated ACSF containing 1% fetal bovine serum. The dissociated cells were filtered through a 20 mm filter and washed with ice-cold ACSF. To remove myelin, the cell pellet was resuspended in PBS and processed with debris removal kit (Miltenyi Biotec). Isolated cells were diluted to 1000 cells/ml in 0.04% BSA/PBS and processed with 10X Genomics platform. The library preparation and sequencing were performed following 10X Genomics Chromium protocols.
